# 🔢 Responsive Counter Application

## Overview

This project is a standalone, fully functional web application designed to demonstrate proficiency in essential front-end technologies: HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The application serves as an interactive numerical counter with three core functions.

## ✨ Features and Design

* **1. Core Functionality:** The counter includes three essential action buttons:
    * **Increment:** Adds 1 to the current count.
    * **Decrement:** Subtracts 1 from the current count.
    * **Reset:** Sets the count back to zero (0).

* **2. Dynamic UI Feedback:**
    * The displayed numerical value is updated in real-time.
    * The color of the count dynamically changes (e.g., Neon Green for positive, Neon Red for negative, Neutral for zero) to provide immediate visual feedback.

* **3. Design Aesthetic (Dark Mode):**
    * The UI features a clean, high-impact **Dark Mode** design using deep background colors and vibrant **Neon Accents** for a modern, high-tech look.

* **4. Full Responsiveness:**
    * The layout is built using **CSS Flexbox** to ensure the counter is perfectly centered on the screen.
    * Buttons stack vertically on smaller mobile devices to maintain excellent usability and readability.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **HTML:** HTML5 Semantic Markup.
* **CSS:** CSS3 (Custom Properties for color variables, Flexbox, and Media Queries).
* **JavaScript:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), used for all DOM manipulation and counter logic.


3.  **Open the file:** Locate the main HTML file (`index.html`) and open it directly in your web browser.
